        <p><h3>I personally think that KVB is a good school with amazing students. The school(Kendriya Vidyalaya) is present all over in India and in some countries too. Being a govt. school, it requires less fees. It provides basic facalities and is affordable. Discipline is followed in this school but the students don't follow discipline. You can find every type of student in each class. From friend to foe, from backbenchers to frontbenchers, from monitor to rebel and more. In this some teachers are just super fantastic but some are not too. The school says that teaching grammar is illegal in the school but I dunno why do they ask it in exams. No matter what but I love my school and I am proud to be a Kvian.(❁´◡`❁)(●'◡'●)</h3></p>
